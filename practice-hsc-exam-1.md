**Section II**

**50 marks**
**Attempt Questions 21–28**
**Allow about 1 hour and 25 minutes for this section**

Answer the questions in the spaces provided. These spaces provide guidance for the expected length of response.

**Question 21** ♊️ (4/4 marks)  

Distinguish between primary data and secondary data in terms of TWO of the following:
*   Relevance
*   Accuracy
*   Validity

> Primary data refers to data that is collected for the system, whereas secondary data refers to data that is collected for another purpose, and used in a system. In other words, secondary data is not directly sourced. Primary data is collected for the purpose of the enterprise system, hence it is typically more relevant than secondary data, as the collection methodology is designed to fulfill the objectives of the collection. However, research conducted to fulfill primary data may not be as accurate as secondary data if the methodology of collection is flawed. Both primary and secondary data can be accurate as long as the collection methodology is closely inspected to ensure that there are no biases or errors in the methodology. 

**Question 22** (6 marks)

(a) Define data sampling. **(1 mark)** ♊️: 1/1
> Data sampling is the process of taking a subset of large dataset, repreesnting a specific or whole population, for analysis.

(b) Outline ONE reason why data sampling is used in data analysis. **(2 marks)** ♊️: 2/2
> Data sampling may be used in data analysis in order to reduce the computational load of generating analytics on big data. This allows researchers to obtain insights, draw conclusions, or understand patterns and trends in datasets without analysing every single data point.

(c) Describe ONE potential issue associated with non-probability sampling methods. **(3 marks)** ♊️: 3/3
> Non-probability sampling refers to sampling that is based on convience, or other non-random criteria, and hence each member of a population does not have a set probability of being selected for analysis. An example of this is snowball sampling, where participants recruit other participants. As the selection process is not random and the **probability of inclusion** is not controlled, certain **subgroups may be overrepresented or underrepresented**. This can result in false conclusions and biased insights.

**Question 23** (4 marks)

Outline TWO advantages and TWO disadvantages of using unstructured data compared to structured data.

**Question 24** (6 marks)

(a) What is a database schema? **(2 marks)**

(b) Explain the purpose of primary keys and foreign keys in a relational database schema. **(4 marks)**

Explain how EACH of the following software features can impact data privacy and security:

(a) Use of public Wi-Fi connections vs private connections **(4 marks)**

(b) Pre-checked checkboxes in online forms **(4 marks)**

**Question 26** (6 marks)

(a) Define data warehousing. **(2 marks)**

(b) Describe how data warehousing supports the analysis of historical trends and patterns, providing ONE specific example. **(4 marks)**

**Question 27** (8 marks)

Explain the purpose of data visualisation in EACH of the following contexts:

(a) Simplifying understanding **(4 marks)**

(b) Telling a story **(4 marks)**

**Question 28** (8 marks)

*   Data Source
*   Data Validation

In your answer, refer to:
*   Specific types of bias (e.g., selection, measurement, confirmation, automation, unconscious)
*   The potential impact on the final visualisation and audience interpretation
*   Strategies to mitigate bias

**Question 30** (15 marks)

An enterprise plans to implement a new system to collect customer data, including purchase history, website interactions, and demographic information, to improve marketing and product development.

Discuss the key ethical AND legal considerations the enterprise must address when collecting and using this customer data in Australia.

In your answer, refer to:
*   Core ethical principles (e.g., Respect for Persons/Autonomy, Privacy, Transparency, Data Minimization)
*   Relevant Australian legislation and principles (e.g., Privacy Act, APPs)
*   The concept of Informed Consent
