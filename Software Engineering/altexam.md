Of course. Here is an alternative Higher School Certificate practice examination for Software Engineering, designed to be slightly more challenging than the example provided.

This examination has been generated with reference to the core themes of the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) Software Engineering 11-12 Syllabus (2022), which is first examined in the 2025 HSC. It focuses on areas such as secure software architecture, software automation, machine learning, programming for the web, and the object-oriented paradigm.

Place the following steps of a binary search algorithm in the correct logical order. The algorithm searches for a `target` value within a sorted `array`.

```
my answer:

BEGIN BinarySearch(array, target)
  Set low = 0
  Set high = LENGTH(array) - 1

*   ::WHILE low <= high

**Question 10 (2 marks)**

Analyse the provided structure chart for a university enrolment system.

**(Note: A more complex structure chart would be displayed. It shows a root module 'Process Enrolment'. It has sub-modules 'Validate Student ID', 'Check Course Availability', and 'Finalise Enrolment'. 'Validate Student ID' passes 'student_status' up. 'Check Course Availability' takes 'course_code' and 'student_status' and passes 'is_available' up. 'Finalise Enrolment' takes 'student_id', 'course_code' and passes 'confirmation_details' up. A loop exists around 'Check Course Availability' labelled 'Until valid course selected'.)**

Which of the following statements are TRUE?
(More than one may be selected.)

A. `is_available` is a control flag. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
B. High cohesion is demonstrated by the 'Validate Student ID' module. ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
C. The system exhibits tight coupling between the 'Validate Student ID' and 'Check Course Availability' modules.

**Question 11 (3 marks)**

Consider the following algorithm designed to determine a user's discount level based on their account type and years of membership.

```
BEGIN calculateDiscount
  Get accountType, membershipYears
  IF accountType == 'Premium' AND membershipYears >= 5 THEN
    discount = 0.20
  ELSEIF accountType == 'Premium' AND membershipYears < 5 THEN
    discount = 0.15
  ELSEIF accountType == 'Standard' AND membershipYears >= 10 THEN
    discount = 0.10
  ELSE
    discount = 0.0
  ENDIF
  Display "Discount is ", discount
END calculateDiscount

**Question 14 (4 marks)**

A movie streaming service offers the following subscription plans:
*   **Basic:** $9.99/month
*   **Standard:** $15.99/month
*   **Premium:** $21.99/month

Customers who opt for an annual subscription receive a 15% discount on the total yearly cost. An algorithm is needed to calculate a customer's subscription cost.

Write an algorithm in pseudocode to solve this problem. The algorithm must:
*   Accept the plan type ('Basic', 'Standard', 'Premium') and billing cycle ('Monthly', 'Annual') as inputs.
*   Use a subroutine to calculate the total cost based on the inputs.
*   Display the final calculated cost, formatted to two decimal places.

**Question 21 (6 marks)**

A program is required to manage a software project's task list. Tasks are stored in a data structure, where each task has a `name`, a `priority` (1-5, where 5 is highest), and a `status` ('Pending', 'In Progress', 'Complete').

The data is stored as a list of dictionaries in Python:
```python
tasks = [
    {'name': 'Setup Database', 'priority': 5, 'status': 'Complete'},
    {'name': 'Design UI', 'priority': 4, 'status': 'In Progress'},
    {'name': 'Develop Auth', 'priority': 5, 'status': 'Pending'},
    {'name': 'Write Tests', 'priority': 3, 'status': 'Pending'},
]
```
Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Defines a function `display_pending_tasks(task_list)` that takes the list of tasks as an argument.
2.  The function should sort the pending tasks by `priority` in descending order (highest priority first).
3.  The function should then print the names of only the 'Pending' tasks in their sorted order.

**Question 24 (5 marks)**

A local library wants to model its book lending system.
*   The system has **Members** and **Books**.
*   A **Book** has an `ISBN`, `title`, and `author`. A **Book** can also be a special type of book called a **ReferenceBook**, which cannot be borrowed.
*   A **Member** has a `memberID`, `name`, and can borrow multiple books. The relationship is that one Member can borrow many Books.
*   The system also models the loan itself. A **Loan** object is created when a book is borrowed. It has a `dueDate` and links a specific **Member** to a specific **Book**.

Create a UML class diagram that models this system, showing classes, attributes, and the relationships between them (including inheritance and multiplicity).

**(Note: A drawing tool would be available here in the digital exam.)**

**Question 25 (8 marks)**

A fast-growing e-commerce startup is deciding on its future software architecture. The current system is a **monolithic application**, where the user interface, product catalog, shopping cart, and payment processing are all part of a single, large codebase.

The lead architect has proposed migrating to a **microservices architecture**, where each of these components would become a separate, independently deployable service that communicates via APIs.

Discuss the trade-offs of this proposed migration from a monolithic to a microservices architecture. In your answer, you must evaluate the impact on:
*   **Scalability:** How easily the system can handle increased load.
*   **Maintainability & Development Speed:** The ease of updating, fixing, and adding new features.
*   **System Complexity & Security:** The overall difficulty in managing the system and the potential security implications.
