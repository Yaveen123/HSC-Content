**Section II**

**50 marks**
**Attempt Questions 21–28**
**Allow about 1 hour and 25 minutes for this section**

Answer the questions in the spaces provided. These spaces provide guidance for the expected length of response.

**Question 21** ♊️ (4/4 marks)  

Distinguish between primary data and secondary data in terms of TWO of the following:
*   Relevance
*   Accuracy
*   Validity

> Primary data refers to data that is collected for the system, whereas secondary data refers to data that is collected for another purpose, and used in a system. In other words, secondary data is not directly sourced. Primary data is collected for the purpose of the enterprise system, hence it is typically more relevant than secondary data, as the collection methodology is designed to fulfill the objectives of the collection. However, research conducted to fulfill primary data may not be as accurate as secondary data if the methodology of collection is flawed. Both primary and secondary data can be accurate as long as the collection methodology is closely inspected to ensure that there are no biases or errors in the methodology. 

**Question 22** (6 marks)

(a) Define data sampling. **(1 mark)** ♊️: 1/1
> Data sampling is the process of taking a subset of large dataset, repreesnting a specific or whole population, for analysis.

(b) Outline ONE reason why data sampling is used in data analysis. **(2 marks)** ♊️: 2/2
> Data sampling may be used in data analysis in order to reduce the computational load of generating analytics on big data. This allows researchers to obtain insights, draw conclusions, or understand patterns and trends in datasets without analysing every single data point.

(c) Describe ONE potential issue associated with non-probability sampling methods. **(3 marks)** ♊️: 3/3
> Non-probability sampling refers to sampling that is based on convience, or other non-random criteria, and hence each member of a population does not have a set probability of being selected for analysis. An example of this is snowball sampling, where participants recruit other participants. As the selection process is not random and the **probability of inclusion** is not controlled, certain **subgroups may be overrepresented or underrepresented**. This can result in false conclusions and biased insights.

**Question 23** (4 marks)

Outline TWO advantages and TWO disadvantages of using unstructured data compared to structured data.
> Advantage of unstructured data: Unstructured data can give more rich and nuanced information, unlike structured data which forces data to be constrained into categories.
> Advantage of unstructured data: The collection of unstructured data can be easier than strucutred data as the data does not need to instantly conform to predefined schema.
> Disadvantage of unstructure data: Unstructured data can become very difficult to analyse for patterns and trends due to the unsorted nature of the data.
> Disadvantage of unstructured data: Unstructured data can be difficult to store and manage because of the lack of inherent organisation can result in many varied formats. Relational databases are significantly easier to store, manage, and retireve from due to their structured nature.

**Question 24** (6 marks)

(a) What is a database schema? **(2 marks)** ♊️: 2/2
> A database schema refers to the framework that defines the logical flow and structure of a database. Schema defines distinct tables, the types of data within them, and the attributes (columns) within each table, and the relationships between the data within those tables, like primary and foreign keys. 

(b) Explain the purpose of primary keys and foreign keys in a relational database schema. **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
https://pastebin.com/aRVyqnc6
> A relational database schema refers to a schema that defines the structure of the database, the tables and the attributes within them, and the relationships between those tables. These relationships are defined through the use of primary and foreign keys. Using the example of a relational database which stores purchase history of customers, for every customer in the customer table, they will be given a primary key which is a unique representation of them as a record. The customer's unique primary key will be used as a reference for each purchase they make in the foreign purchase history table. The primary key becomes a foreign key. Primary keys are used to uniquely identify a specific record within a table and facilitates the easy retrieval, modification, and deletion of a record within a table. Foreign keys are useful for establishing a relationship between two tables, and the relationship between primary and foreign keys can enforce referential integrity to ensure no foreign key is orphaned. For example, through the use of a foreign key, a relational database system can check that no purchase is created under a customer that doesn't exist, or a customer is not deleted if they have have purchase history in the system. Through foreign keys, relationships like one-to-one, many-to-many, one-to-many, many-to-one relationships can be created, allowing for the efficient organisation and querying of related data across multiple tables. 

**Question 25** (8 marks)

Explain how EACH of the following software features can impact data privacy and security:

(a) Use of public Wi-Fi connections vs private connections **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
> Negative impact on privacy: Public wifi connections refer to wifi connections that are open to anyone in the public to use. These wifi connections are typically unsecured, meaning data packets in transit are readable if intercepted. Malicious actors who read potentially unencrypted data packets can pose as a significant privacy risk as the confidentiality of the data is compromised. Bad actors can potentially access sensitive data like browsing history through interception on public networks, and potentially obtain PII which can have significant repercussions on the user.
> Positive impact on privacy: Private wifi refer to wifi connections where only specific, authorised individuals are able to access the wifi connection. This significantly reduces the chances of bad actors from being on a network, protecting the confidieniality of data on the network. Private wifi connections often have security in place to prevent attacks, making it difficult for bad actors from accessing data on the network. 
> Negative impact on security: As public wifi connections are open to anyone, and are often not secured, anyone can view the contents of data packets if unencrypted. The contents inside can pose a significant security risk, as they could include passwords or sensitive PII. Malicious actors can use this data to log into accounts, risking the integrity and confidientality of data.
> Positive impact on security: Private wifi connections prevent these attacks, positively impacting data security.

(b) Pre-checked checkboxes in online forms **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
> Pre-checked checkboxes play a role that impacts data security and privacy. While pre-checked checkboxes can speed up the user flow of a system, when labels are misleading or represent multiple unrelated actions, pre-checked checkboxes can cause users unknowingly consent to significant data processing actions. This can compromise the privacy of a user's data. Pre-checked checkboxes in online forms also pose a security vulnerability as they could authorise the collection of sensitive data for malicious purposes, and/or authorise the collection of data that could increase the problems associated with a data breach, creating a security vulnerability. An example of pre-checked boxes causing a security vulnerability is opting a user unknowingly into emails that contain phishing links, and/or exposing their emails to unrealiabile, unsecure data vendors. 

**Question 26** (6 marks)
 
(a) Define data warehousing. **(2 marks)** ♊️: 2/2
> Data warehousing refers to the **storage of large datasets on a specific large subject**, like customer history. Data is **collected from multiple sources, cleaned, processed, and integrated into the data warehouse in a time-oriented fashion**. This data is **non-volatile**, as it's often not updated or deleted. **Data warehouses facilitate analytics**, enabling the discovery of trends, and patterns in historical data. 

(b) Describe how data warehousing supports the analysis of historical trends and patterns, providing ONE specific example. **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
> Data warehouses store large datasets through the **integration of multiple data sources**. When integrated into the data warehouse, records are **time focused** and **non-volatile**, resulting in a comprehensive **outlook on the history of a large subject**. For example, a store, ShopSmart, collects data on the large subject of customer behaviour, integrating data from customer purchase history, online shopping activity, search history, and analytical data from 3rd party trackers. Business intelligence tools can generate key insights based on the data warehouse, as they can look for historical trends and patterns in the data. For example, ShopSmart's business intelligence looks at customer purchase history based on time, and finds that during november/december, the sale of christmas-themed chocolates spikes. This prompts ShopSmart to increase the availability of christmas-themed chocolates through broadening and increasing the stock of related products and reducing prices.

**Question 27** (8 marks) 

Explain the purpose of data visualisation in EACH of the following contexts:

(a) Simplifying understanding **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
> Data visualisation refers to the creation of graphical elements or other **visualisation of datasets to increase their accessibility**. Visualising datasets often require data sampling, which **reduces the cognitive load of processing the data**. Visualisation also accentuates trends in datasets, such as a line graph showing the increase in rainfall over a given period. Through these, datasets are simplified to enhance understanding, as they highlight important trends and reduce cognitive of a specific dataset.

(b) Telling a story **(4 marks)** ♊️: 4/4
> Through the accentuation of trends, **data visualisation is able to highlight specific aspects of a dataset and simplify understanding of a dataset**. Through that, and the combination of various visualised data sources, data visualisation is able to tell a story. **Data visualsations can be arranged and presented in a sequence to guide the audience through a story, for example starting with the context**, showing a prolem, and then presenting a solution illustrating the impact. The choice of visuals and annotiatons/labels on visualised data are able to evoke emotion in views, shaping their understanding of a certain story.
