3.  The graph below shows the concentration of antibodies in a person's blood following exposure to an antigen.

    [Imagine a graph showing a small, slow primary response peaking around day 14, then declining. A second exposure around day 28 causes a much larger, faster secondary response peaking around day 35.]

**Question 6 (7 marks)**

A hospital laboratory tested the effectiveness of four different antibiotics (P, Q, R, S) against three common bacterial species (X, Y, Z). Agar plates were inoculated with each bacterium, and discs containing the antibiotics were placed on the surface. After incubation, the diameter of the zone of inhibition (clear area where bacteria did not grow) around each disc was measured in millimetres. The results are shown below:

| Antibiotic | Zone of Inhibition (mm) - Bacterium X | Zone of Inhibition (mm) - Bacterium Y | Zone of Inhibition (mm) - Bacterium Z |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| P          | 15                                   | 0                                    | 18                                   |
| Q          | 22                                   | 25                                   | 20                                   |
| R          | 8                                    | 10                                   | 7                                    |
| S          | 0                                    | 0                                    | 0                                    |

**Answer Guide & Marking Criteria:**

*   **Section I (Multiple Choice):**
    1.  (D) Virus - Key features: non-cellular, genetic material in protein coat, requires host.
    2.  (C) Vector transmission - Mosquito acts as a biological vector.
    3.  (C) Graph shows typical primary (slow, low peak) and secondary (fast, high peak) antibody responses.
    4.  (C) The dependent variable is what is measured as the outcome (bacterial growth).
    5.  (B) Vaccination aims to protect enough individuals to prevent widespread transmission (herd immunity).

*   **Section II (Short Answer):**
    *   **Q6:**
        *   (a) Q (Largest zone for X: 22mm). (1 mark)
        *   (b) S. (1 mark) Justification: It showed 0mm zone of inhibition (no effect) against all three bacteria tested. (1 mark)
        *   (c) Antibiotic diffuses from disc into agar. (1 mark) If effective, it inhibits/kills bacteria, creating a clear zone where concentration is sufficient. (1 mark) Larger zone = higher sensitivity/effectiveness. (1 mark)
        *   (d) Bacterium Y possesses a gene conferring resistance (e.g., encoding an enzyme that breaks down the antibiotic, or altering the antibiotic's target site). OR Has features like a capsule preventing entry. (1 mark for plausible biological reason)
    *   **Q7:**
        *   (a) Before Year X, cases were high and fluctuated significantly (epidemic peaks). (1 mark)
        *   (b) After Year X, cases dropped dramatically (1 mark) and remained consistently low (near zero) compared to before vaccination (1 mark - needs comparison/quantification e.g. from >50k to <1k).
        *   (c) Vaccination introduces antigens (weakened/killed virus/viral parts) stimulating primary immune response (1 mark). This creates memory B and T cells (1 mark). Upon subsequent exposure to actual measles, secondary response is rapid and strong, preventing illness (1 mark). Widespread vaccination reduces susceptible hosts, preventing transmission chains (herd immunity). (1 mark)
    *   **Q8:**
        *   (a) IV: Type of disinfectant (or solution). DV: Zone of inhibition diameter (or bacterial growth). (1 mark each)
        *   (b) Any two relevant: Incubation temperature, incubation time, concentration of *E. coli* initially spread, volume/concentration of disinfectant on disc, size of paper disc, type of nutrient agar. (1 mark each)
        *   (c) Validity is low/limited. (1 mark) Major flaw: no replication - only one plate per treatment. (1 mark) Cannot be sure if results are due to disinfectant effectiveness or random variation/error on that specific plate. (1 mark)
        *   (d) Repeat the experiment multiple times (e.g., 3-5 plates per disinfectant) and calculate an average zone of inhibition. (1 mark)
    *   **Q9:**
        *   (a) Graph construction: See checklist above. (4 marks)
        *   (b) This shows the primary immune response. (1 mark) There's a lag phase (Day 0-7 approx) as B cells specific to the pathogen are identified and activated. (1 mark) Then, proliferation/differentiation into plasma cells leads to increasing antibody production, peaking around Day 14, then declining as the infection is cleared. (1 mark)
