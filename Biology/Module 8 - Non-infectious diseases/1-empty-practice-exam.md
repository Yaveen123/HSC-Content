**Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (5 marks)**
*Answer all questions. Choose the best response.*

**1. Which of the following correctly describes a negative feedback mechanism in homeostasis?**
    (A) A response that amplifies the original stimulus.
    ➡️ (B) A response that counteracts the original stimulus to return the body to a set point.
    (C) A process that only involves the nervous system.
    (D) A mechanism that always leads to a pathological condition.

**2. A student is investigating the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in two different populations over 10 years. What type of epidemiological study is this most likely to be?**
    (A) Case-control study
    (B) Intervention trial
    (C) Descriptive study
    ➡️ (D) Cohort study

**3. Which of the following is primarily a genetic disease?**
    (A) Mesothelioma
    (B) Scurvy
    ➡️ (C) Cystic Fibrosis
    (D) Lung cancer due to smoking

**4. The maintenance of a relatively constant internal body temperature despite changes in the external environment is known as:**
    (A) Osmoregulation
    (B) Glucoregulation
    ➡️ (C) Thermoregulation
    (D) Excretion

**5. An epidemiologist observes a strong correlation between high salt intake and increased blood pressure in a large population study. What can be reasonably concluded?**
    (A) High salt intake definitively causes high blood pressure.
    ➡️ (B) There is an association between high salt intake and high blood pressure, warranting further investigation.
    (C) Reducing salt intake will cure high blood pressure in everyone.
    (D) The study design must have been flawed as correlation does not imply causation.

**Section B: Short Answer Questions (38 marks)**
*Answer all questions in the spaces provided.*

**Question 6 (5 marks)**
Describe the negative feedback loop involved in thermoregulation when a person is exposed to a cold environment. Ensure you identify the stimulus, receptor, control centre, and effector(s) involved.

**Question 7 (4 marks)**
The graph below shows the blood glucose levels of two individuals, Person A and Person B, after consuming a sugary drink at Time = 0 minutes.

**(Imagine a simple line graph here: Y-axis "Blood Glucose Level (mmol/L)", X-axis "Time (minutes)". Person A's line starts at ~5, spikes to ~10-11 by 60 mins, then gradually returns to ~5 by 120-150 mins. Person B's line starts at ~6-7, spikes much higher to ~15-16 by 60-90 mins, and remains elevated or drops very slowly, still well above normal by 150 mins.)**

(a) Identify which person (A or B) is likely to have impaired glucose regulation (e.g., diabetes). Justify your answer using data from the graph. (2 marks)

**(Space for answer)**

(b) Name ONE hormone responsible for lowering blood glucose levels after the sugary drink. (1 mark)

**Question 11 (6 marks)**
The table below shows data collected from an epidemiological study investigating the link between regular physical activity and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a population of 10,000 adults over 20 years.

| Group                      | Number of Individuals | New Cases of CVD over 20 years | Incidence Rate (per 1000 person-years) |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Regular Physical Activity  | 4,000                 | 160                            | 2.0                                    |
| Low Physical Activity      | 6,000                 | 540                            | 4.5                                    |

(a) Identify the group with the higher incidence rate of CVD. (1 mark)

**(Space for answer)**

(b) Calculate how many times more likely an individual in the 'Low Physical Activity' group is to develop CVD compared to an individual in the 'Regular Physical Activity' group, based on the incidence rates. Show your working. (2 marks)

**(Space for answer)**

(c) Based on this data, suggest ONE public health recommendation that could be made. (1 mark)

**(Space for answer)**

(d) Outline ONE limitation of relying solely on this type of data to conclude that low physical activity *causes* CVD. (2 marks)

**(Space for answer)**
