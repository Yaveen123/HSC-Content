**Question 12 (7 marks)**

(a) Distinguish between structural, physiological, and behavioural adaptations. **(3 marks)**

> Adaptations aim to improve the selective advantage of an organism in it's environment. Physiological adaptations involve changes to how the organism functions (i.e. blood vessels vasodialating in humans when body temperature exceeds setpoint), behavioural is what the organism does to survive (i.e. tree snake seeking shade when hot), and structural is changes to it's physical characteristics (i.e. fur on polar bears provide insulation to cold weather).

### **Marking Criteria and Sample Answers**

**Section I - Multiple Choice**

1.  **B** - The goal of negative feedback is to counteract a change and bring a variable back to its set point or normal range.
2.  **D** - Vasodilation increases blood flow to the skin, allowing heat to radiate away from the body, which is a cooling mechanism.
3.  **B** - High glucose from carbohydrates triggers insulin release, which promotes the uptake of glucose by cells and its storage as glycogen in the liver and muscles.
4.  **B** - Sunken stomata create a pocket of still, humid air, which reduces the water potential gradient between the inside of the leaf and the outside air, thus decreasing the rate of transpiration.
5.  **C** - The disease is caused by an error in the genetic material (an extra chromosome), not by diet, environment, or uncontrolled cell growth in the typical sense of cancer.
6.  **B** - If the 'stop' signal (p53) is broken, cells with DNA damage can continue to divide, leading to the accumulation of mutations and uncontrolled proliferation.
7.  **C** - Incidence is the rate of new cases of a disease in a population over a specific period. Prevalence is the total number of cases (new and existing).
8.  **B** - The myelin sheath acts as an electrical insulator, forcing the action potential to 'jump' between the nodes of Ranvier (saltatory conduction), which dramatically increases the speed of transmission.
9.  **C** - A cohort study is an observational study that follows groups of individuals (cohorts) over time to see how certain exposures (like smoking) affect outcomes (like lung disease).
10. **B** - The VLPs are non-infectious but are antigenic, meaning they stimulate the adaptive immune system to produce antibodies and memory B and T cells, providing long-term immunity without causing disease.

**Section II - Short Answer**

**Question 11 (6 marks)**

*Criteria:*
*   **6 marks:** Constructs a clear, logical diagram showing all components (stimulus, receptor, control centre, effector, response) for a decrease in temperature. Correctly identifies shivering and vasoconstriction as responses.
*   **4-5 marks:** Constructs a mostly correct diagram with one or two missing/incorrect components or links.
*   **2-3 marks:** Shows a basic understanding of a feedback loop but has significant omissions or errors.
*   **1 mark:** Identifies one or two correct components.

*Sample Answer:*

**(Stimulus)**
Body temperature drops below 37°C (e.g., due to cold environment)
↓
**(Receptor)**
Thermoreceptors in the skin and hypothalamus detect the decrease in temperature.
↓
**(Control Centre)**
The hypothalamus in the brain processes the information and coordinates a response.
↓
**(Effector)**
1. Skeletal muscles
2. Arterioles in the skin
3. Thyroid gland (long-term)
↓
**(Response)**
1. Muscles contract rapidly and involuntarily (shivering), generating heat.
2. Arterioles constrict (vasoconstriction), reducing blood flow to the skin surface to conserve heat.
3. Thyroid hormones may increase metabolic rate, generating more heat.
↓
**Body temperature rises back towards 37°C (Negative Feedback)**

**Question 12 (7 marks)**

(a) *Criteria:*
*   **3 marks:** Correctly defines or distinguishes between all three types of adaptations.
*   **2 marks:** Correctly defines or distinguishes between two types.
*   **1 mark:** Correctly defines one type.

*Sample Answer:*
A **structural adaptation** is a physical feature of an organism's body, relating to its size, shape or anatomy (e.g., thick fur). A **physiological adaptation** is an internal process or function related to the organism's metabolism or body chemistry (e.g., producing concentrated urine). A **behavioural adaptation** is an action or something the organism does to survive in its environment (e.g., being nocturnal).

(b) *Criteria:*
*   **4 marks:** Provides a correct example for each of the three adaptation types for a bilby and explains how each one aids homeostasis.
*   **2-3 marks:** Provides correct examples for 2-3 types but with a weak or missing explanation for one.
*   **1 mark:** Provides one correct example with an explanation.

*Sample Answer:*
*   **Structural:** The bilby has very large, thin ears with a rich blood supply. This large surface area allows for efficient heat radiation away from the body, helping to cool it down and maintain its core temperature in the hot desert.
*   **Physiological:** The bilby produces highly concentrated urine. This is a physiological process that allows it to excrete waste products while minimising water loss, which is crucial for maintaining water balance (osmoregulation) in an arid environment.
*   **Behavioural:** The bilby is nocturnal and spends the hot days in a deep, cool burrow. This behaviour allows it to avoid the extreme heat of the desert sun, reducing heat gain and the need for excessive cooling mechanisms, thus conserving energy and water.

**Question 13 (8 marks)**

(a) *Criteria:*
*   **2 marks:** Describes the trend for both males and females, including the relationship between them.
*   **1 mark:** Describes the trend for either males or females, or provides a vague description.

*Sample Answer:*
The graph shows that the incidence of melanoma has generally increased for both males and females from 1982 to 2018. The incidence in males has consistently been higher than in females throughout this period.

(b) *Criteria:*
*   **3 marks:** Correctly identifies UV radiation, links it to DNA damage/mutation, and explains how this leads to uncontrolled cell division/cancer.
*   **2 marks:** Provides a partial explanation, e.g., mentions UV and cancer but not the DNA mutation link.
*   **1 mark:** Identifies UV radiation as the cause.

*Sample Answer:*
The main environmental factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation is a mutagen that can penetrate skin cells and damage their DNA. If this damage occurs in genes that control the cell cycle (like tumour suppressor genes), the cell may lose its ability to regulate its own division. This leads to uncontrolled mitosis, where the cell divides rapidly and uncontrollably, forming a malignant tumour known as melanoma.

(c) *Criteria:*
*   **3 marks:** Names a specific campaign, outlines its key messages, and links these messages to reducing the risk factor.
*   **2 marks:** Names a campaign and provides some detail but the link to risk reduction is weak.
*   **1 mark:** Names a campaign.

*Sample Answer:*
A major public health campaign in Australia is the "Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek, Slide" campaign by the Cancer Council. It outlines five key steps for sun protection. **Slip** on protective clothing, **Slop** on broad-spectrum sunscreen, **Slap** on a hat, **Seek** shade, and **Slide** on sunglasses. This campaign aims to educate the public on how to reduce their exposure to UV radiation, which is the primary environmental cause of skin cancer, thereby lowering their risk of developing the disease.

**Question 14 (5 marks)**

*Criteria:*
*   **5 marks:** Provides a comprehensive explanation that links insulin resistance/deficiency to the failure of glucose uptake, mentions the liver's role, and clearly states this disrupts the negative feedback loop, causing hyperglycemia.
*   **3-4 marks:** Explains the role of insulin and how its reduced effectiveness causes high blood sugar, but may have less detail on the feedback loop or liver.
*   **1-2 marks:** States that insulin is not working properly, leading to high blood sugar, with little further explanation.

*Sample Answer:*
In a healthy person, high blood glucose after a meal is the stimulus for the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts as a key, signalling body cells (especially muscle and fat cells) to take up glucose from the blood and signalling the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen for storage. This lowers blood glucose, completing a negative feedback loop.

In Type 2 diabetes, this mechanism is disrupted. Body cells become **insulin resistant**, meaning they no longer respond effectively to the insulin signal. As a result, glucose is not taken up from the blood efficiently. The liver also fails to adequately store glucose as glycogen. This breakdown in the response part of the feedback loop means that blood glucose levels remain high (hyperglycemia), despite the pancreas often producing large amounts of insulin initially. This chronic high blood sugar can then lead to further health complications.

**Question 15 (9 marks)**

*Criteria:*
*   **8-9 marks:** Provides a sophisticated evaluation. Identifies multiple strengths (e.g., large sample, use of control group, longitudinal) and weaknesses (e.g., healthy worker bias, confounding variables, limited scope). Makes a clear, justified judgement on the overall validity. Suggests multiple specific and relevant improvements.
*   **5-7 marks:** Provides a good evaluation. Identifies some strengths and weaknesses and makes a judgement. Suggestions for improvement are present but may be general.
*   **3-4 marks:** Describes some features of the method, identifying at least one strength or weakness. The judgement is simple or absent.
*   **1-2 marks:** Makes one or two relevant statements about the method.

*Sample Answer:*
This epidemiological study provides preliminary evidence for a link between the factory chemical and liver disease, but its methodology has significant limitations that affect its validity.

**Strengths of the method:**
1.  **Large Sample Size:** Using 2,000 workers in each group is a large sample, which increases the statistical power and makes the results more likely to be representative and not due to chance.
2.  **Use of a Control Group:** Comparing the factory workers to a control group of office workers is essential for determining if the rate of disease is higher than in the general population. Matching for age and sex helps to reduce the influence of these variables.
3.  **Cohort Design:** The 10-year longitudinal design is a strength as it allows the researcher to track the development of disease over time and establish a temporal relationship (i.e., that the exposure preceded the disease).

**Weaknesses and Recommendations for Improvement:**
1.  **Confounding Variables:** The study fails to account for major confounding variables that cause liver disease, such as alcohol consumption, diet, or viral hepatitis infections. The higher incidence in factory workers could be due to lifestyle differences, not the chemical.
    *   **Improvement:** The study should collect data on these confounding variables for all participants (e.g., through questionnaires on diet and alcohol intake, and blood tests for hepatitis) and use statistical analysis to adjust for their effects.
2.  **Selection Bias (Healthy Worker Effect):** The study only used *current* factory workers. This introduces a "healthy worker effect," where people who became too sick (potentially from the chemical exposure) to continue working would have left their jobs and been excluded from the study. This would lead to an underestimation of the chemical's true effect.
    *   **Improvement:** The study should attempt to trace and include former employees of the factory in the analysis to get a more accurate picture of the disease incidence.
3.  **Limited Scope:** The study was conducted at a single factory. The results may not be generalisable to other factories or populations, as there could be unique environmental factors or workplace practices at this specific site.
    *   **Improvement:** The study should be expanded to include workers from multiple factories that use the same chemical to increase the generalisability of the findings.

**Overall Evaluation:**
While the study's use of a large, matched control group and a cohort design are strengths, the failure to control for major confounding variables and the potential for healthy worker bias severely limit its validity. It suggests a correlation, but it cannot confidently establish causation. Therefore, the method is weak, and the results should be considered preliminary until further research incorporating the suggested improvements is conducted.
