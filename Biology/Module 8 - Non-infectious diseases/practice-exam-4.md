### **Marking Criteria and Sample Answers**

**Section I: Multiple Choice (1 mark each)**
1.  **B** – Epidemiology is the study of disease in populations.
2.  **B** – Prevalence = (Total cases / Total population) = (500+50)/10000 = 0.055 or 5.5%. Incidence is the rate of *new* cases.
3.  **D** – A cohort study follows a group (cohort) forward in time to observe outcomes.
4.  **C** – Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for liver cancer and is unrelated to working in the factory. If not controlled for, it would be a confounding factor, mixing its effect with the effect of the chemical.
5.  **B** – Incidence (new cases) is falling, and the gap between incidence and mortality is widening, suggesting survival rates are improving (i.e., treatments are more effective).

**Section II: Short and Extended Answer**

**Question 6 (7 marks)**
**(a) Describe the trends shown in the graph. (2 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Correctly describes the trend for cigarette consumption (rises to a peak around 1960-65 then declines).
    *   1 mark: Correctly describes the trend for lung cancer deaths (rises steadily, lagging behind consumption, and peaks around 1985-90 before starting to decline).
*   **Sample Answer:** Per capita cigarette consumption rises sharply from 1925, peaks around 1965, and then shows a steady decline. Lung cancer deaths per 100,000 people begin to rise around 1945, increasing steeply to a peak around 1990, after which they begin to fall.

**(b) Explain the time lag. (2 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   2 marks: Provides a logical biological explanation related to the nature of cancer development (mutations accumulate over time, disease has a long latency period).
*   **Sample Answer:** Cancer is a multi-step process that develops over a long period. Exposure to carcinogens in cigarettes causes DNA mutations. It takes many years for sufficient mutations to accumulate in cells, bypass cell cycle checkpoints, and develop into a detectable tumour, leading to the observed time lag between exposure (smoking) and disease outcome (death).

**(c) Outline ONE other type of evidence. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies a valid line of evidence (e.g., animal experimentation, cellular pathology, identification of carcinogens).
    *   2 marks: Describes the approach and findings of the chosen evidence.
*   **Sample Answer:** Another line of evidence was **animal experimentation**. In these studies, laboratory animals such as mice had tobacco tar applied to their skin. This induced the growth of cancerous tumours, demonstrating that substances within cigarettes were carcinogenic and could directly cause cancer in a controlled setting, strengthening the link beyond correlation in humans.

**Question 7 (10 marks)**
**(a) Describe the method for a case-control study. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies the two groups: one with the disease (cases) and one without (controls).
    *   1 mark: Explains that the study looks back in time (retrospective).
    *   1 mark: Describes comparing the past exposure to the risk factor (pesticide) in both groups to find an association.
*   **Sample Answer:** The researcher would select a group of people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (the 'cases'). They would then select a comparable group of people without Parkinson's disease (the 'controls'), matched for age and sex. The study would then be retrospective, looking back in time by interviewing or examining records for both groups to determine and compare their past levels of exposure to the specific pesticide.

**(b) Identify ONE example of selection bias and ONE example of information bias. (4 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies a plausible selection bias (e.g., healthy worker bias, volunteer bias).
    *   1 mark: Explains how this bias would affect the study's results.
    *   1 mark: Identifies a plausible information bias (e.g., recall bias, interviewer bias).
    *   1 mark: Explains how this bias would affect the study's results.
*   **Sample Answer:**
    *   **Selection Bias:** Healthy worker bias. If the 'control' group was selected from currently employed farm workers and the 'case' group included retired workers, the control group might appear healthier and have different exposure histories, skewing the results.
    *   **Information Bias:** Recall bias. Individuals with Parkinson's disease (cases) may think more carefully about their past and be more likely to remember and report exposure to pesticides than healthy individuals (controls), leading to an overestimation of the association.

**(c) Evaluate the benefits of conducting this study. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   Makes a judgement on the value of the study.
    *   Identifies at least two distinct benefits with justification (e.g., for individuals, government, public health policy).
*   **Sample Answer:** This study provides significant benefits. Firstly, it can identify a modifiable risk factor, allowing for the creation of public health policies and workplace regulations to limit pesticide exposure, thereby preventing future cases of the disease. Secondly, for individuals and communities, it provides knowledge that allows them to make informed choices to reduce their personal risk. Finally, it guides future research into the biological mechanisms of the disease, potentially leading to new treatments. Therefore, the study is highly beneficial for public health and safety.

**Question 8 (13 marks)**
**(a) Explain the mechanism by which HPV leads to cancer. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: States that HPV inserts its genetic material into host cervical cells.
    *   1 mark: Identifies that viral proteins are produced.
    *   1 mark: Explains that these proteins interfere with cell cycle regulation, specifically by deactivating tumour suppressor proteins like p53, leading to uncontrolled cell division.
*   **Sample Answer:** HPV, a virus, infects cervical cells and integrates its DNA into the host cell's genome. The host cell then transcribes and translates the viral DNA, producing viral proteins. Certain high-risk HPV strains produce proteins that deactivate crucial tumour suppressor proteins, such as p53. The normal function of p53 is to halt the cell cycle and trigger apoptosis (cell death) if DNA damage is detected. When p53 is deactivated, cells with mutations can continue to divide uncontrollably, leading to the formation of a tumour.

**(b) Analyse how screening and vaccination work. (4 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   2 marks for screening: Explains it involves early detection (of HPV or abnormal cells) and allows for treatment before cancer develops, reducing incidence and mortality.
    *   2 marks for vaccination: Explains it provides immunity by introducing antigens (VLPs) to trigger an immune response, preventing the initial HPV infection, thus preventing the cause of the cancer and reducing incidence.
*   **Sample Answer:**
    *   **Screening Program:** The national screening program works through early detection. The HPV test identifies the presence of the virus before cellular changes occur, while the old Pap test identified pre-cancerous cells. By detecting the cause or early signs of the disease, individuals can be monitored and pre-cancerous lesions can be removed before they develop into invasive cancer. This directly reduces incidence and, by catching it early, dramatically reduces mortality.
    *   **Vaccination Program:** The HPV vaccine (e.g., Gardasil) works by preventing the disease from ever starting. It contains virus-like particles (VLPs) which are antigens that stimulate the immune system to produce memory B and T cells against specific HPV strains. This provides long-term immunity, so if a vaccinated person is exposed to HPV, their immune system quickly neutralises the virus. This prevents infection and therefore prevents the development of cervical cancer, reducing future incidence rates.

**(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of using these programs. (6 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   **5-6 marks:** Makes an explicit and well-reasoned judgement on effectiveness (e.g., highly effective). Provides a coherent and logical argument linking epidemiological studies to the development of both prevention (vaccine) and management (screening) strategies. Uses specific evidence from the cervical cancer example (e.g., falling incidence/mortality rates, identification of HPV as cause) to support the judgement.
    *   **3-4 marks:** Describes the link between epidemiology and the health programs. Makes a judgement but with limited justification or evidence. Describes strategies rather than evaluating their overall effectiveness as a combined approach.
    *   **1-2 marks:** Identifies some basic points, such as "studies are useful". Provides a limited or general answer.
*   **Sample Answer:** The use of epidemiological studies and subsequent public health programs has been exceptionally effective in managing and preventing cervical cancer in Australia. Epidemiological studies were fundamental to this success. Initially, descriptive studies showed patterns in cervical cancer rates, while analytical studies (case-control and cohort) definitively established the link between HPV infection and the disease. This identification of a specific cause was the critical breakthrough.

This knowledge directly enabled the development of two powerful, evidence-based strategies. Firstly, it justified the national screening program. Knowing that HPV caused slow-developing cell changes allowed for a program to detect and treat these changes early, drastically reducing mortality rates, as seen in the steady decline in deaths since the program's inception in 1991.

Secondly, and more powerfully, identifying the viral cause paved the way for a primary prevention strategy: the HPV vaccine. This biotechnological solution, informed by epidemiological findings, aims to prevent the disease entirely. The national vaccination program is projected to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Australia in the coming decades.

In conclusion, the combination of epidemiological research to identify a cause, followed by targeted screening and vaccination programs, represents a highly effective, multi-pronged public health model. The dramatic and sustained fall in both incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in Australia provides clear evidence of its profound success.
