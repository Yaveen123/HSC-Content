*(Image adapted from graph on page 9 of source material)*

(a) Describe the trends shown in the graph for both cigarette consumption and lung cancer deaths. **(2 marks)**
> The graph shows a positive trend in cigarettes sold per adult per day reaching a peak of 10-11 cigarettes/adult/day in 1960, then steadily declines onwards. Moreover, the rate of lung cancer deaths per 100000 men steadily increase, reaching a peak in 1990 at 55/100000 men, then steadily declining. 

(b) Explain the time lag of approximately 20-25 years between the peak in cigarette consumption and the peak in lung cancer deaths. **(2 marks)**
> Smoking introduces carcinogens which damages DNA in lung cells, causing mutations that tumors that accumulate into cancerous tissue, which over 20-25 years can develop into a fatal state. The highest exposure of carcinogens in cigarettes leads to the peak in incidence of lung cancer, which develops into a fatal state 20-25 years after.

(c) This graph shows a strong correlation but does not prove causation. Outline ONE other type of evidence that was required to establish smoking as the cause of the lung cancer epidemic. **(3 marks)**
> An experimental study is required. Researchers need to see if carcinogens found in cigarettes damage DNA in lungs, causing lung cancer. This can be done through animal models, where incidence of lung tumor development in animals exposed vs not exposed is observed. If carcinogens are proven to cause tumour onset, then researchers can establish causation between lung cancer epidemic and carcinogen exposure due to increased cigarette use

**Question 7** (10 marks)

A researcher is conducting an epidemiological study to investigate if exposure to a specific pesticide used in agriculture increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, a non-infectious neurodegenerative disorder.

(a) The researcher decides to conduct a case-control study. Describe the method for this study. **(3 marks)**
> The researcher will gather participants who have parkinsons and participants who do not have parkinsons. The researcher will look at participant activity history and observe exposure to the specific pesticide. The researcher will compare the frequency of pesticide exposure to those in the parkinsons group vs non-parkinsons group. The researcher must ensure controls like age, gender, and lifestyle are matched throughout both groups.

(b) Identify ONE example of selection bias and ONE example of information bias that could occur in this study. **(4 marks)**
> Selection bias: volunteer bias - those who choose to participate in the study may be a specific part of the population and may not actually represent the full population
> Information bias: recall bias - participants may not be able to accurately recall their experiences with pesticides

(c) Evaluate the benefits of conducting this epidemiological study for the community. **(3 marks)**
> The results of the study will inform pesticide usage within the community. If the study conclusively finds a strong correlation with parkinsons and pesticide usage, the community may reduce or eliminate their use of that specific pesticide. This may lead to a decereased incidence of parkinsons, benefitting the community.

**Question 8** (13 marks)

The prevention and management of cervical cancer in Australia is a major public health success story. Information and data related to this were presented in your booklet.

(a) The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause of cervical cancer. Explain the biological mechanism by which HPV infection can lead to the development of cancer. **(3 marks)**
> -- _memory of specific cases are not shown in exam_

(b) Australia has implemented two key strategies to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer: a national screening program and a national vaccination program.

Analyse how EACH of these strategies works to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. **(4 marks)**
> Screening program: A screening program detects and treats pre-cancerous cells. This catches the cancer early, reducing the mortality rate of cervical cancer. This prevents the progression of pre-cancerous cells, reducing the incidence of cervical cancer
> Vaccination of boys and girls against HPV: By reaching herd immunity against HPV, which is one of the leading causes of cervical cancer, the incidence rate is reduced, thus also reducing mortality rates.

(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of using epidemiological studies and public health programs to manage and prevent a non-infectious disease, using cervical cancer in Australia as an example. **(6 marks)**

### **Marking Criteria and Sample Answers**

**Section I: Multiple Choice (1 mark each)**
1.  **B** – Epidemiology is the study of disease in populations.
2.  **B** – Prevalence = (Total cases / Total population) = (500+50)/10000 = 0.055 or 5.5%. Incidence is the rate of *new* cases.
3.  **D** – A cohort study follows a group (cohort) forward in time to observe outcomes.
4.  **C** – Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for liver cancer and is unrelated to working in the factory. If not controlled for, it would be a confounding factor, mixing its effect with the effect of the chemical.
5.  **B** – Incidence (new cases) is falling, and the gap between incidence and mortality is widening, suggesting survival rates are improving (i.e., treatments are more effective).

**Section II: Short and Extended Answer**

**Question 6 (7 marks)**
**(a) Describe the trends shown in the graph. (2 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Correctly describes the trend for cigarette consumption (rises to a peak around 1960-65 then declines).
    *   1 mark: Correctly describes the trend for lung cancer deaths (rises steadily, lagging behind consumption, and peaks around 1985-90 before starting to decline).
*   **Sample Answer:** Per capita cigarette consumption rises sharply from 1925, peaks around 1965, and then shows a steady decline. Lung cancer deaths per 100,000 people begin to rise around 1945, increasing steeply to a peak around 1990, after which they begin to fall.

**(b) Explain the time lag. (2 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   2 marks: Provides a logical biological explanation related to the nature of cancer development (mutations accumulate over time, disease has a long latency period).
*   **Sample Answer:** Cancer is a multi-step process that develops over a long period. Exposure to carcinogens in cigarettes causes DNA mutations. It takes many years for sufficient mutations to accumulate in cells, bypass cell cycle checkpoints, and develop into a detectable tumour, leading to the observed time lag between exposure (smoking) and disease outcome (death).

**(c) Outline ONE other type of evidence. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies a valid line of evidence (e.g., animal experimentation, cellular pathology, identification of carcinogens).
    *   2 marks: Describes the approach and findings of the chosen evidence.
*   **Sample Answer:** Another line of evidence was **animal experimentation**. In these studies, laboratory animals such as mice had tobacco tar applied to their skin. This induced the growth of cancerous tumours, demonstrating that substances within cigarettes were carcinogenic and could directly cause cancer in a controlled setting, strengthening the link beyond correlation in humans.

**Question 7 (10 marks)**
**(a) Describe the method for a case-control study. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies the two groups: one with the disease (cases) and one without (controls).
    *   1 mark: Explains that the study looks back in time (retrospective).
    *   1 mark: Describes comparing the past exposure to the risk factor (pesticide) in both groups to find an association.
*   **Sample Answer:** The researcher would select a group of people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (the 'cases'). They would then select a comparable group of people without Parkinson's disease (the 'controls'), matched for age and sex. The study would then be retrospective, looking back in time by interviewing or examining records for both groups to determine and compare their past levels of exposure to the specific pesticide.

**(b) Identify ONE example of selection bias and ONE example of information bias. (4 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: Identifies a plausible selection bias (e.g., healthy worker bias, volunteer bias).
    *   1 mark: Explains how this bias would affect the study's results.
    *   1 mark: Identifies a plausible information bias (e.g., recall bias, interviewer bias).
    *   1 mark: Explains how this bias would affect the study's results.
*   **Sample Answer:**
    *   **Selection Bias:** Healthy worker bias. If the 'control' group was selected from currently employed farm workers and the 'case' group included retired workers, the control group might appear healthier and have different exposure histories, skewing the results.
    *   **Information Bias:** Recall bias. Individuals with Parkinson's disease (cases) may think more carefully about their past and be more likely to remember and report exposure to pesticides than healthy individuals (controls), leading to an overestimation of the association.

**(c) Evaluate the benefits of conducting this study. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   Makes a judgement on the value of the study.
    *   Identifies at least two distinct benefits with justification (e.g., for individuals, government, public health policy).
*   **Sample Answer:** This study provides significant benefits. Firstly, it can identify a modifiable risk factor, allowing for the creation of public health policies and workplace regulations to limit pesticide exposure, thereby preventing future cases of the disease. Secondly, for individuals and communities, it provides knowledge that allows them to make informed choices to reduce their personal risk. Finally, it guides future research into the biological mechanisms of the disease, potentially leading to new treatments. Therefore, the study is highly beneficial for public health and safety.

**Question 8 (13 marks)**
**(a) Explain the mechanism by which HPV leads to cancer. (3 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   1 mark: States that HPV inserts its genetic material into host cervical cells.
    *   1 mark: Identifies that viral proteins are produced.
    *   1 mark: Explains that these proteins interfere with cell cycle regulation, specifically by deactivating tumour suppressor proteins like p53, leading to uncontrolled cell division.
*   **Sample Answer:** HPV, a virus, infects cervical cells and integrates its DNA into the host cell's genome. The host cell then transcribes and translates the viral DNA, producing viral proteins. Certain high-risk HPV strains produce proteins that deactivate crucial tumour suppressor proteins, such as p53. The normal function of p53 is to halt the cell cycle and trigger apoptosis (cell death) if DNA damage is detected. When p53 is deactivated, cells with mutations can continue to divide uncontrollably, leading to the formation of a tumour.

**(b) Analyse how screening and vaccination work. (4 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   2 marks for screening: Explains it involves early detection (of HPV or abnormal cells) and allows for treatment before cancer develops, reducing incidence and mortality.
    *   2 marks for vaccination: Explains it provides immunity by introducing antigens (VLPs) to trigger an immune response, preventing the initial HPV infection, thus preventing the cause of the cancer and reducing incidence.
*   **Sample Answer:**
    *   **Screening Program:** The national screening program works through early detection. The HPV test identifies the presence of the virus before cellular changes occur, while the old Pap test identified pre-cancerous cells. By detecting the cause or early signs of the disease, individuals can be monitored and pre-cancerous lesions can be removed before they develop into invasive cancer. This directly reduces incidence and, by catching it early, dramatically reduces mortality.
    *   **Vaccination Program:** The HPV vaccine (e.g., Gardasil) works by preventing the disease from ever starting. It contains virus-like particles (VLPs) which are antigens that stimulate the immune system to produce memory B and T cells against specific HPV strains. This provides long-term immunity, so if a vaccinated person is exposed to HPV, their immune system quickly neutralises the virus. This prevents infection and therefore prevents the development of cervical cancer, reducing future incidence rates.

**(c) Evaluate the effectiveness of using these programs. (6 marks)**
*   **Criteria:**
    *   **5-6 marks:** Makes an explicit and well-reasoned judgement on effectiveness (e.g., highly effective). Provides a coherent and logical argument linking epidemiological studies to the development of both prevention (vaccine) and management (screening) strategies. Uses specific evidence from the cervical cancer example (e.g., falling incidence/mortality rates, identification of HPV as cause) to support the judgement.
    *   **3-4 marks:** Describes the link between epidemiology and the health programs. Makes a judgement but with limited justification or evidence. Describes strategies rather than evaluating their overall effectiveness as a combined approach.
    *   **1-2 marks:** Identifies some basic points, such as "studies are useful". Provides a limited or general answer.
*   **Sample Answer:** The use of epidemiological studies and subsequent public health programs has been exceptionally effective in managing and preventing cervical cancer in Australia. Epidemiological studies were fundamental to this success. Initially, descriptive studies showed patterns in cervical cancer rates, while analytical studies (case-control and cohort) definitively established the link between HPV infection and the disease. This identification of a specific cause was the critical breakthrough.

This knowledge directly enabled the development of two powerful, evidence-based strategies. Firstly, it justified the national screening program. Knowing that HPV caused slow-developing cell changes allowed for a program to detect and treat these changes early, drastically reducing mortality rates, as seen in the steady decline in deaths since the program's inception in 1991.

Secondly, and more powerfully, identifying the viral cause paved the way for a primary prevention strategy: the HPV vaccine. This biotechnological solution, informed by epidemiological findings, aims to prevent the disease entirely. The national vaccination program is projected to make cervical cancer a rare disease in Australia in the coming decades.

In conclusion, the combination of epidemiological research to identify a cause, followed by targeted screening and vaccination programs, represents a highly effective, multi-pronged public health model. The dramatic and sustained fall in both incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in Australia provides clear evidence of its profound success.
