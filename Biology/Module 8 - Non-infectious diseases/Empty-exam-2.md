Okay, this version will be more challenging, focusing on deeper understanding, data interpretation, critical evaluation, and integration of concepts, as expected at a higher HSC level. It will also aim for a slightly higher mark total within the 60-minute timeframe, pushing the pace.

**Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (4 marks)**
*Answer all questions. Choose the best response.*

    (D) Descriptive cross-sectional study

**2. The failure of which homeostatic mechanism is most directly implicated in the development of oedema (fluid accumulation in tissues)?**

    (B) Glucoregulation 
    (C) Osmoregulation ⬅️
    (D) pH balance

**3. A genetic mutation in a proto-oncogene that leads to its continuous activation, even in the absence of growth signals, is likely to result in:**
    (A) Apoptosis of the affected cell.
    (B) Increased cell differentiation.
    (C) Uncontrolled cell proliferation. ⬅️
    (D) Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms.

**4. An epidemiological study reports a relative risk (RR) of 3.5 for developing lung cancer among individuals exposed to asbestos compared to unexposed individuals. This indicates that:**
    (A) Asbestos exposure causes 3.5% of all lung cancer cases.
    (B) Individuals exposed to asbestos are 3.5 times more likely to develop lung cancer than those not exposed. ⬅️
    (C) For every 3.5 people exposed to asbestos, one will develop lung cancer.
    (D) Asbestos exposure is only one of 3.5 factors contributing to lung cancer.

**Section B: Short Answer Questions (38 marks)**
*Answer all questions in the spaces provided.*

**Question 5 (7 marks)**
The graph below illustrates the hormonal response to changes in blood glucose concentration.

**(Imagine a graph: Y-axis "Hormone Concentration (arbitrary units)", X-axis "Time". Two lines: Insulin starts low, rises significantly after "Glucose Ingestion" at T=0, then falls. Glucagon starts moderate, dips slightly after glucose ingestion, then rises as insulin falls and blood glucose drops below baseline, then returns to moderate.)**

(a) Identify Hormone X (the one that rises after glucose ingestion) and Hormone Y (the one that rises when blood glucose falls below baseline). (1 mark)
> Hormone X = Insulin, Hormone Y= glucagon

(b) Explain the role of Hormone X in maintaining glucose homeostasis after glucose ingestion. (3 marks)
> Insulin allows sugars to be absorbed into cells. When high sugar is present, insulin increases, as cells are able to turn sugars into energy or store it as excess fat. This reduces the amount of glucose in the blood, reducing the amount of insulin and closing the negative feedback loop.


(c) Describe ONE specific cellular mechanism by which Hormone Y acts to increase blood glucose levels. (2 marks)
> Hormone Y - Glucagon - is present in higher quantities when blood sugar is below set point. Glucagon activates glycogenolysis in liver cells to convert glycogen into glucose, increasing blood sugar levels, lowering the level of glucagon and closing the negative feedback loop.

(d) Predict ONE consequence if the target cells for Hormone X become resistant to its action. (1 mark)
> Insulin resistance means that cells have a reduced response to insulin, not taking in sugar properly. This means that there is excess blood sugar in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis.

**Question 7 (7 marks)**
A cohort study followed 5,000 individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 5,000 individuals with no family history of CVD for 20 years. All participants were initially free of CVD. The study aimed to investigate the influence of a specific dietary intervention (low saturated fat, high fibre) on CVD incidence.

| Group                                       | Number Started | Dietary Intervention | No Dietary Intervention | New CVD Cases (Intervention) | New CVD Cases (No Intervention) |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Family History of CVD**                   | 5,000          | 2,500                | 2,500                   | 150                          | 350                           |
| **No Family History of CVD**                | 5,000          | 2,500                | 2,500                   | 75                           | 125                           |

(a) Calculate the incidence rate of CVD (per 1,000 persons) for individuals with a family history of CVD who received *no dietary intervention*. Assume the 20-year period for calculation. (2 marks)

**(Space for answer)**

(b) Analyse the data to determine if the dietary intervention appears to be effective in reducing CVD incidence in *both* groups. Support your answer with calculations or comparative statements. (3 marks)

**(Space for answer)**

(c) Identify ONE potential confounding variable that could affect the interpretation of these results, and explain how it could do so. (2 marks)

**Question 9 (Extended Response - 8 marks)**
Critically evaluate the role of epidemiological studies in understanding, preventing, and managing a named non-infectious disease that has a significant multifactorial basis (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, or a specific cancer like lung cancer).

In your answer, ensure you:
*   Name the non-infectious disease.
*   Discuss how different types of epidemiological studies (e.g., descriptive, analytical) have contributed to identifying risk factors and understanding the disease's distribution.
*   Explain how findings from these studies inform the development of specific prevention strategies and public health interventions.
*   Analyse the limitations or challenges faced by epidemiological research in establishing causality and influencing public health policy for your chosen disease.
