#### **Section 2 â€“ Short Answer Questions (40 marks)**

**Question 17 (8 marks)**
a)
1.  **External Entity:** A source or destination of data outside the system. Example: `Student`.
2.  **Process:** An activity that transforms data. Example: `Process Enrolment`.
3.  **Data Store:** A repository of data. Example: `Courses` or `Students`.
4.  **Data Flow:** The movement of data between other components. Example: `Enrolment Request` or `Enrolment Confirmation`.

b)
A new data store named `Finance` would be added to the diagram. A data flow arrow, labelled `Fee Status`, would go from the `Finance` data store to the `Process Enrolment` process. This shows the process is retrieving the fee information to verify payment before it sends the `Enrolment Confirmation` to the student.

**Question 18 (10 marks)**
a) `=C2*D2`
b) `=IF(D4=0, "Out of Stock", C4*D4)`
c) The rule would be: "Format cells that are LESS THAN 15". This rule would be applied to the range D2:D5, and a formatting style (e.g., red fill) would be chosen.
d) A pivot table is a tool used to summarise, group, and analyse large amounts of data from a table or spreadsheet. With this data, a pivot table could be used to quickly calculate the total stock value for all products or find the average unit price without needing to write individual formulas.

**Question 19 (10 marks)**
a) The relationship is **one-to-many**. One agent can be assigned to many properties, but one property can only be assigned to one agent. The `AgentID` foreign key in the `Property` table establishes this link.

b)
```sql
SELECT Address, ListPrice
FROM Property
WHERE ListPrice > 500000;
```

c)
```sql
SELECT Agent.FirstName, Agent.LastName, Property.Address
FROM Agent
JOIN Property ON Agent.AgentID = Property.AgentID;
```

**Question 20 (12 marks)**
a) Task C "Backend Dev" can be performed in parallel with Task B "UI Design".

b) A dependent task is a task that cannot begin until one or more other tasks have been completed. For example, Task D "App Coding" is a dependent task. It cannot start until both Task B "UI Design" and Task C "Backend Dev" are finished.

c) If Task C takes 6 weeks, it will now finish at the end of week 8 (2 weeks for Task A + 6 weeks for Task C). Since Task D depends on both B and C, it cannot start until the latest predecessor is complete. Task B finishes at the end of week 5, but Task C now finishes at the end of week 8. Therefore, Task D cannot start until the beginning of week 9. This pushes the entire project back by 2 weeks. The start date of Task E will also be delayed by 2 weeks.

d) A project milestone is a specific point in a project's lifecycle used to measure progress. It is an event, not a task, and has zero duration. A suitable milestone would be "All Development Complete", placed after Task D is finished, or "Project Kick-off" before Task A.

#### **Section 3 - Extended Response (40 marks)**

**Question 21 (10 marks)**
**SAMPLE ANSWER:**
Developing an AI diagnostic system for a hospital raises significant social and ethical issues.
**Bias** is a primary concern. If the system is trained on historical medical data that underrepresents certain demographics (e.g., specific ethnicities or genders), its diagnostic accuracy for those groups could be dangerously low. This could perpetuate and even amplify existing health disparities, leading to misdiagnoses for minority patients. The data used must be carefully audited for representativeness.
**Privacy** is crucial as the system handles highly sensitive patient health information (PHI). There must be robust security measures to prevent data breaches, adhering to health regulations like HIPAA. Patients must give informed consent for their data to be used by the system, and the data should be anonymised wherever possible to protect patient identity. The potential for data misuse or unauthorised access is a major ethical risk.
**Accountability** presents a complex challenge. If the AI system provides an incorrect diagnosis that leads to patient harm, who is responsible? Is it the hospital, the doctors who used the system, or the developers who created the software? Clear lines of accountability must be established. The system should be treated as a decision-support tool, with the final clinical judgment and responsibility remaining with the human doctor, who must understand the system's limitations.

**Question 22 (12 marks)**
**SAMPLE ANSWER:**
When developing an online learning platform for a large company with evolving needs, the choice of development methodology is critical.

The **Waterfall methodology** is a linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing) must be completed before the next begins.
*   **Suitability for this project:** This model would be poorly suited. Its rigidity means all requirements must be defined upfront. For a dynamic learning platform where new features are expected frequently, this is impractical. If the company wanted to add a new type of quiz or a social feature mid-development, it would be difficult and costly to go back and change the specifications.
*   **Contrast:** The key drawback is its inflexibility and the late stage at which a working product is delivered to stakeholders for feedback.

The **Agile methodology** is an iterative approach where the project is broken down into small cycles or "sprints." A small, functional piece of the product is developed in each sprint and demonstrated to stakeholders.
*   **Suitability for this project:** This model is highly suitable. It allows for continuous feedback from the company's training department, ensuring the platform meets their needs as it evolves. New features can be prioritised and added to the backlog for future sprints, making the system adaptable. For instance, the first version might only include basic video modules, with interactive quizzes and discussion forums added in subsequent iterations based on user feedback.
*   **Contrast:** Unlike Waterfall, Agile embraces change and prioritises stakeholder collaboration and a working product over comprehensive documentation.

**Recommendation:**
I would strongly recommend the **Agile methodology**. Its iterative nature is perfect for a project where requirements are expected to change and expand. It allows the development team to deliver value quickly and adapt to the needs of the 10,000 employees and the training department. This flexibility reduces the risk of building a platform that doesn't meet user needs and ensures the final product is both useful and engaging.

**Question 23 (8 marks)**
**SAMPLE ANSWER:**
a) **Benefits of Outsourcing:**
1.  **Access to Specialised Expertise:** The company can hire an external firm that specialises in building CRM systems. This provides access to experienced developers, project managers, and business analysts who have deep knowledge of best practices, which the company's in-house IT team may lack. This can lead to a higher quality product.
2.  **Cost Reduction and Focus on Core Business:** Outsourcing can be cheaper than hiring, training, and retaining a specialised in-house development team, especially for a one-off project. It converts a fixed cost (salaries) into a variable cost (project contract). This also allows the company to focus its own resources and employees on its primary business activities rather than on a complex IT project.

b) **Risks of Outsourcing:**
1.  **Loss of Control and Communication Challenges:** The company gives up direct day-to-day control over the development process. Time zone differences, language barriers, and cultural differences can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings of requirements, and delays. Ensuring the final product meets the precise business needs can be difficult.
2.  **Data Security and Privacy Risks:** The company must share sensitive customer data with the external vendor. This creates a significant security risk. If the outsourced company has poor security practices, it could lead to a data breach, damaging the company's reputation and potentially leading to legal penalties. A thorough vetting of the vendor's security protocols is essential.

**Question 24 (10 marks)**
**SAMPLE ANSWER:**
a)
1.  **GPS unit:** This is a **sensor**. Its function is to receive signals from satellites to determine and measure its physical geographic location. It is detecting information from the environment.
2.  **Temperature monitor:** This is a **sensor**. Its purpose is to measure the physical property of temperature within the refrigerated compartment. It detects the current state.
3.  **Mechanism to automatically lock cargo doors:** This is an **actuator**. Based on a signal from the control system (e.g., a command from the driver or an automated trigger), it performs a physical action: moving the lock into place. It is acting on the environment.

b)
To tell a story about delivery efficiency, a data visualisation could combine GPS and traffic data on an interactive map. One could use a **heatmap layer** over the city map, where colors represent traffic density (e.g., red for heavy, green for light). A **line chart** could be synchronized with the map, plotting average delivery times against the time of day. By animating the map and chart over a 24-hour period, the company could clearly demonstrate how high-traffic periods (visible as red areas on the map) directly correlate with spikes in delivery times on the chart. This visual story would effectively argue for scheduling more deliveries during off-peak hours to improve efficiency.
